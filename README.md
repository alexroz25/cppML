# C++ Digit Recognizer

This repository contains my implementation of a 3-layer neural network to predict the digit drawn in a 28x28 pixel canvas, using the famous MNIST dataset to train and test my model. My implementation does not use any pre-made machine learning or matrix libraries since I wanted to gain a complete understanding of how these basic neural networks operate. While this project gets the job done, it also has lots of room for optimization in the future.

## Instructions

1. Download source files
2. Download mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv from the MNIST dataset source below and place them in the same folder
3. Adjust LEARNING_RATE and EPOCHS as desired
4. Run main.cpp

## MNIST dataset source:
